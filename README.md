# The Bob's Burgers API

The [Bob's Burgers API](https://bobsburgers-api.herokuapp.com/) is a REST/GraphQL API based on the television show Bob's Burgers. The Bob's Burgers API contains data for hundreds of characters, episodes, running gags and images from the show.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

This project requires two environment variables to be added to a `.env` file, `DATABASE_URL` (required) and `PORT` (optional). If `PORT` is not defined, then port 5000 will be selected by default.

> ‚ùó **IMPORTANT:** The database URL must match the format mongodb+srv://{username}:{password}@{cluster}/{database}

### Installation

Install the required dependencies with Yarn.

```bash
yarn install
```
